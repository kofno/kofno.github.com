### Land of Lisp

I received 'Land of Lisp' last Christmas and worked it all in CLISP
right away. I haven't (or hadn't) touched a line of Common Lisp since.
So, to shake the rust off, I decided to break it out again.  This
time, I'm working it all using SBCL.  Most of the code is the same.
I've provided READMEs or comments in places where I had to deviate
from the book.  Today I pushed 'Chapter 15, The Dice of Doom'.

If you're interested, I've stashed my [repo on github](https://github.com/kofno/land-of-lisp).
