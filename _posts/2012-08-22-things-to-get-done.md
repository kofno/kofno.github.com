### Things Tod Do Over the Next Few Weeks

Just a quick list of reminders to myself of things I'd like to get done, tech-wise.

* Vim (Note: largely inspired by a stint using Sublime Text 2)
  * Find or write a basic 'Go to Anything' functionality in Vim. Key, not needing to know full file paths to find stuff.
  * Decide a good way to run builds form Vim and capture the output.

* Add Knockout JS to todo sample app.
* Rewrite sample app in the Interactor style

* Learn some HTML5 / JS
  * Play around with HTML5 canvas libraries
  * Try out progress bar / file upload for HTML5
  * Try out local storage in HTML5

* Akka from JRuby

* Deploy a JRuby Rack app on TorqueBox. (todo app maybe)

This is probably enough for a few weeks. Just need to get on it.
